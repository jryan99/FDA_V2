## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/) (for database management)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jryan99/API_ADMIN.git
   cd API_ADMIN
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the database:**
   - Ensure `fdx.db` exists, or run the provided SQL scripts to initialize the schema.

4. **Start the API server:**
   ```sh
   node fdx-api.js
   ```
   - The server will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured port).

## Usage

- Access the admin UI at `http://localhost:3000/public/admin.html`
- Use the REST API endpoints for programmatic access to customers, accounts, and transactions.
- Example endpoints:
  - `GET /customers/:customerId`
  - `GET /accounts?customerId=...`
  - `GET /accounts/:accountId/transactions`

## Development

- All source code is in the project root and `public/` directory.
- Modify `fdx-api.js` and related files to extend or customize functionality.
- Static assets (HTML, JS, CSS) are served from the `public/` directory.
