Here is a **reworked `README.md`** that accurately reflects your project’s current state and objective as a **Financial Data Aggregator prototype** using Plaid Link and FDX APIs to simulate a Data Out use case.  
This version is concise, professional, and tailored to your architecture and goals.

# Financial Data Aggregator Prototype (FDA_V2)

## Overview

**FDA_V2** is a prototype web application and API server that demonstrates a **Data Out use case** for open banking.  
It enables a customer to **link their bank account using Plaid Link** and then **retrieve their financial data**—including contact, account, transaction, and statement information—via FDX-aligned APIs.

The goal is to simulate a modern, standards-based data sharing experience, showing how a consumer can control and export their financial data to third-party applications using industry protocols.

## Features

- **Plaid Link Integration:**  
  Customers can securely link their bank accounts using the Plaid Link widget.

- **FDX-Aligned API Endpoints:**  
  Simulates a provider-side Financial Data Exchange (FDX) API, returning customer, account, transaction, and statement data in FDX format.

- **Professional Web UI:**  
  Responsive, Fidelity-branded dashboard for linking accounts and viewing retrieved data.

- **Data Out Simulation:**  
  Models the consumer experience of exporting their financial data to an external app or aggregator.

- **Node.js/Express Backend:**  
  RESTful API server with modular code, SQLite database, and clear separation of UI and API logic.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/) (for local database)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jryan99/FDA_V2.git
   cd FDA_V2
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the database:**
   - Ensure `fdx.db` exists, or run the provided SQL scripts to initialize the schema.

4. **Start the API server:**
   ```sh
   node fdx-api.js
   ```
   - The server will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured port).

## Usage

- **Web UI:**  
  Open `http://localhost:3000/public/index.html` in your browser to use the Fidelity-style dashboard and simulate account linking and data retrieval.

- **API Endpoints:**  
  Use REST endpoints to retrieve FDX-format data:
    - `GET /api/openbank/customer/:customerId`
    - `GET /api/openbank/accounts?customerId=...`
    - `GET /api/openbank/transactions?customerId=...`
    - `GET /api/openbank/statements?customerId=...`

- **Plaid Link:**  
  The UI will launch Plaid Link for simulated account linking.  
  (Configure your Plaid sandbox credentials in the environment as needed.)

## Development

- All source code is in the project root and `public/` directory.
- Modify `fdx-api.js`, `main.js`, and `style.css` to extend or customize functionality.
- Static assets (HTML, JS, CSS) are served from the `public/` directory.

## Objective

This project demonstrates how a financial institution or fintech can implement a **Data Out** solution using **Plaid Link for account authentication** and **FDX APIs for secure, standards-based data sharing**.  
It is intended for prototyping, demonstration, and educational purposes in the context of open banking and consumer data rights.
